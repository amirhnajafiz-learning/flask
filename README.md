# Flasking

Implement a full website with Python Flask framework.

This is a course that I watched from youtube, about creating a website with python Flask framework.

## Tools we need to setup the project

First things first, install flask framework:
```shell
pip install flask
```

Flask-log in provides user session management for flask.
Check the github sourse in [here](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login).
Install flask-login module:
```shell
pip install flask-login
```

Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy to your application. It aims to simplify using SQLAlchemy with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to accomplish common tasks.
Install it:
```shell
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```
